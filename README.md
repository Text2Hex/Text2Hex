# Text2Hex
Text2Hex is an application where you can convert either text to hex, or hex to text.


# How do i download this?
Go to the releases, and choose the latest release. There are 3 versions, but if you aren't into computers, I would suggest using the GUI version.
If you don't mind and only want text to hex, download Text2Hex Classic. I made that as a beta and didn't want to release it, but it only felt right.
If you still want a console interface but want a two way converter, I'd suggest the non GUI 2 way converter.

# How do i use this? (Classic)
Open "Text2HexClassic.exe" and type the text you would like to convert.
Click enter, and it should show the hex conversion
Note that with Classic you can only convert text to hex.

# How do i use this? (GUI 2 WAY)
Open Text2HexTW-GUI.exe
Choose the conversion type you would like
Type the hex/text you would like to use.
Click Convert.

# How do i use this? (Non GUI 2 WAY)
Open Text2HexTW-Non-GUI.exe
Type 1/2 (1 does Text to Hex and 2 does Hex to Text.)
Enter text/hex
It should show the conversion. 
Note that only one conversion can happen every session with every session with non GUI!

# How do i delete Text2Hex?
Just go to the folder that contains either "Text2HexClassic.exe", "Text2HexTW-GUI.exe", or "Text2HexTW-Non-GUI.exe" and delete everything.
